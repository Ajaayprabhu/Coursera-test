	<ul>
		<li><b> Extended Kalman Filter design for vehicle position tracking using GPS,IMU,LIDAR </b>
			<div>An extended Kalman filter is designed for localization of the vehicle and predicting the trajectory in which it must move with the help of fusing data from multiple sensors such as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS (Global Positioning System).An analysis is made based on the error obtained on the estimated trajectory on combinations of IMU, IMU+GPS , IMU+GPS+LIDAR</div>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b> Detection of presence and absence of Helmet using CNN</b>
			<div>A YOLO (You Only Look Once) model was trained for the purpose of detection of helmet. If the person in the given image image fails to wear a helmet we crop the number plate of his vehicle and we send the image to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) . Using the extracted number plate details we can directly find the details regarding the rider using VAHAN API.</div>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b> Designed a Low-cost water level sensor along with Transmission for smart cities:</b>
			<div>A low-cost water level sensor which gives information about level of liquid present in a tank and this data is transmitted using the communication protocol LoRa. The project was presented at IIT Madras.</div>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Designed an Arm band for women safety:</b>
			<div>An accelerometer-based device which detects a unique hand gesture and if the same hand gesture is detected multiple times a warning signal is transmitted through LoRa to the nearest police station</div>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Over heat protection system:</b>
			<div> A prototype which detects the temperature of the surroundings using lm35 sensor and Arduino. If the temperature increases beyond the set-point value then the alarm starts ringing and a cooling fan is switched ON.</div>
